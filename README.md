# Flutter-Study
All this projects were made following the 'Beginning Flutter Hands On Guide To App Development'

I Started to create the projects since the chapter 6 because the earliers projects were to much simple.

Here is the list of what was learned on the chapter and some prints of my version of the project (I'm specifing that it's my version because it's possible to download all projects here https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Beginning+Flutter%3A+A+Hands+On+Guide+to+App+Development-p-9781119550822)
